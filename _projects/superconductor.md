<p style='text-align: justify;'>It is a comon lore that static external electric fields should have almost no effect on bulk metallic superconductors. This is because standard BCS superconductors contain many free charges that reorganize to screen the electric field, as it happens in normal metals.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Recently, however, it has been reported that a static electric field can be used to control the value of the supercurrent in thin superconductive films. In particular, for a large enough electric field, a transition to the normal metallic phase has been observed. This effect is called Superconductive Field Effect (SFE). In these films the screening length is much smaller then the thickness of the film, which is about the same size as the coherence length, therefore the external electric field should have no effect on the bulk. Furthermore, it was observed that increasing the thickness of the sample completely suppresses the SFE and no transition to the metal phase occurs.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Part of my research deals with trying to understand this effect. Given the universality of the SFE, my advisor's group and I proposed a modified Ginzburg-Landau model that should capture the EFT of the systems below the critical temperature and managed to reproduce the main features of the SFE observed in experiments, but we still have to obtain a derivation from first principles.</p>

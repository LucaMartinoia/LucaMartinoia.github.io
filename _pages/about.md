Hi, my name is Luca! I earned my Ph.D. from the University of Genova and now I am a Postdoctoral researcher in Theoretical Physics at the University of Padova, <a href='https://www.dfa.unipd.it/'>Department of Physics "Galileo Galilei"</a>, in the <a href='https://www.liphlab.com/'>Collaborative Laboratory of Interdisciplinary Physics (LIPh Lab)</a>. I am also associate researcher at the <a href='https://www.ge.infn.it/wordpress/'>INFN</a> under the Statistical Field Theory program.

My main research interest is the theory of <em>Hydrodynamics</em>, with a focus on applications to the phenomenology of strongly-coupled condensed matter systems, to the fluid/gravity duality in Holography, and more recently to soft and active matter. More recently, I started working on theoretical neuroscience.

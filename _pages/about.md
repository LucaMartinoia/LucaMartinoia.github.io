Hi, my name is Luca. I am a theoretical physicist working as project engineer at <a href='http://stamtech.com/'>STAM</a>. I lead R&D projects in defense and air traffic management under the Europe Defense Fund and the SESAR programs.
</div></p>

<p><div style="text-align: justify">
I began my research career at the University of Genova, earning a Ph.D. in theoretical physics. I then joined the <a href='https://www.unipd.it/'>University of Padova</a>, Department of Physics "Galileo Galilei", and the <a href='https://www.liphlab.com/'>LIPh Lab</a> to study theoretical ecology and neuroscience. Since the start of my Ph.D., I was also an associate researcher at <a href='https://www.ge.infn.it/wordpress/'>INFN</a> in the Statistical Field Theory program. Over five years, I worked in small international teams, published in high-impact journals, and presented my work at conferences across Europe.

<p><div style="text-align: justify">
My research spans high-energy physics, statistical physics, and condensed matter. During my Ph.D., I focused on formal aspects of statistical field theory, developing a framework to extend hydrodynamics and better model electron motion in strongly-coupled materials, while also exploring holography, BCS superconductivity, quantum anomalies, and fractons. More recently, my interests broadened to active matter and complex systems, studying collective dynamics in living matter—solving a 30-year-old problem—and modeling brain activity to predict neural responses from internal stochastic dynamics.

<p><div style="text-align: justify">
I am currently involved in European-funded projects, including EDF and SESAR JU, focusing on Defence and Air Traffic Management. In particular, my work in ATM has sparked a growing interest in aviation research, with a focus on cyber-security, ADS-B systems, and communication, navigation, and surveillance (CNS) technologies.

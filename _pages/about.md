Hi, my name is Luca! I am a Postdoctoral researcher in Theoretical Physics at the <a href='https://www.unige.it/it'>University of Genoa</a>, <a href='https://www.difi.unige.it/it'>Department of Physics</a>. I am also associate researcher at the <a href='https://www.ge.infn.it/wordpress/'>INFN</a> under the Statistical Field Theory program. I earned my Ph.D. from the University of Genoa, and soon I will move to the University of Padua to work on the stastistical physics of complex systems.

My main research interest is the theory of <em>Hydrodynamics</em>, with a focus on applications to the phenomenology of strongly-coupled condensed matter systems, to the fluid/gravity duality in Holography, and more recently to soft and active matter.

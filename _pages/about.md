Hi, my name is Luca. I am a Postdoctoral researcher in Theoretical Physics at the University of Genoa, Italy. I am also researcher at INFN, under the Statistical Field Theory program. I earned my Ph.D. from the University of Genoa, and soon I will move to the University of Padua to work on the stastistical physics of complex systems.

My main research interest is the theory of Hydrodynamics, with a focus on applications to the phenomenology of strongly-coupled condensed matter systems, to the fluid/gravity duality in Holography, and more recently to soft and active matter.

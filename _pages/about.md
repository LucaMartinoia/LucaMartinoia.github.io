Hi, my name is Luca. I am a theoretical physicist working as project engineer at <a href='http://stamtech.com/'>STAM</a>. I am currently leading R&D projects in defense and airspace within the Europe Defense Fund and the SESAR programs.
</div></p>

<p><div style="text-align: justify">
I started my researcher career at the University of Genova, where I earned my Ph.D. in theoretical physics, and then moved to the <a href='https://www.unipd.it/'>University of Padova</a>, Department of Physics "Galileo Galilei", in the <a href='https://www.liphlab.com/'>Collaborative Laboratory of Interdisciplinary Physics (LIPh Lab)</a> to study theoretical ecology and neuroscience. I was also associate researcher at <a href='https://www.ge.infn.it/wordpress/'>INFN</a> under the Statistical Field Theory program. During these five years in research, I had the opportunity to work in small international groups, and meet several experts in the fields. I have published several papers in high IF journals and have presented my research findings to the scientific community at international conferences and workshops across Europe.

<p><div style="text-align: justify">
My research interests lie at the intersection between high-energy physics, statistical physics and condensed matter. During my Ph.D. I mostly worked on formal questions of statistical field theory, developing a new theory that expands the regime of applicability of hydrodynamics. The final goal was to better understand how to use fluid dynamics to model the motion of electrons inside strongly-coupled materials. At that time, I also worked on other problems related to holography, BCS superconductivity, quantum anomalies and fractons.

<p><div style="text-align: justify">
More recently, my interests have expanded to other areas, such as active matter and complex systems. While I was working as a postdoctoral researcher I started studying the collective dynamics of living matter, such as flocks and bacteria colonies, solving a 30-year-old problem in the field. In Padova I worked on models of the brain, to understand how to predict its response to external stimuli from its internal stochastic dynamics.

    title = "{Relaxation terms for anomalous hydrodynamic transport in Weyl semimetals from kinetic theory}",
    abstract = {We consider as a model of Weyl semimetal thermoelectric transport a \((3+1)\)-dimensional charged, relativistic and relaxed fluid with a \( U(1)_V\times U(1)_ A\)~chiral anomaly. We take into account all possible mixed energy, momentum, electric and chiral charge relaxations, and discover which are compatible with electric charge conservation, Onsager reciprocity and a finite DC conductivity. We find that all relaxations respecting these constraints necessarily render the system open and violate the second law of thermodynamics. We then demonstrate how the relaxations we have found arise from kinetic theory and a modified relaxation time approximation. Our results lead to DC conductivities that differ from those found in the literature opening the path to experimental verification.},

    title = "{Restoring time-reversal covariance in relaxed hydrodynamics}",
    abstract = {In hydrodynamics, for generic relaxations, the stress tensor and \(U(1)\)~charge current two-point functions are not time-reversal covariant. This remains true even if the Martin-Kadanoff procedure happens to yield Onsager reciprocal correlators. We consider linearized relativistic hydrodynamics on Minkowski space in the presence of energy, \(U(1)\)~charge, and momentum relaxation. We then show how one can find the minimal relaxed hydrodynamic framework that does yield two-point functions consistent with time-reversal covariance. We claim the same approach naturally applies to boost agnostic hydrodynamics and its limits (e.g., Carrollian, Galilean, and Lifshitz fluids).},

    title = "{Leading order magnetic field dependence of conductivities in anomalous hydrodynamics}",
    abstract = {We show that literature results claimed for the magnetic field dependence of the longitudinal conductivity in anomalous first-order hydrodynamics are frame dependent at this derivative order. In particular, we focus on \((3+1)\)-dimensional hydrodynamics in the presence of a constant \(O(\partial)\)~magnetic field with a \(U(1)\)~chiral anomaly and demonstrate that, for constitutive relations up to and including order one in derivatives, the anomaly drops out of the longitudinal conductivity. In particular, magnetic field dependent terms that were previously found in the literature only enter the nonzero frequency thermoelectric conductivities through explicitly frame dependent pieces indicating that they are not physical. This issue can be avoided entirely by incorporating the magnetic field into the fluid’s equilibrium state.},

    title = "{Non-dissipative electrically driven fluids}",
    abstract = {Existing hydrodynamic models of charged fluids consider any external electric field acting on the fluid as either first order in the hydrodynamic derivative expansion and completely arbitrary or zeroth order but constrained by the fluid’s chemical potential. This is in tension with experiments on charged fluids, where the electric field is both zeroth order and completely arbitrary. In this work, we take the first step at resolving this conundrum by introducing a new class of hydrodynamic stationary states, including an arbitrary zeroth order electric field, upon which hydrodynamics can be built. We achieve this by first writing down the hydrostatic constitutive relations for a boost-agnostic charged fluid up to first order in derivatives. Then we introduce suitable energy and momentum relaxation terms to balance the influence of the electric field on the fluid. This analysis leads to a new hydrostatic constraint on the spatial fluid velocity, which can be used to define our class of states. This constraint generalizes to the realm of hydrodynamics a similar constraint on the velocity found in the Drude model of electronic transport. Our class of states exhibits non-trivial thermo-electric transport even at ideal order, since it hosts non-zero DC electric and heat currents. We derive the explicit form of the corresponding conductivities and show they depend non-linearly on the electric field.},

    abstract = {In this paper, we use a Ginzburg-Landau approach to show that a suitably strong electric field can drive a phase transition from a superconductor to a normal metal. The transition is induced by taking into account corrections to the permittivity due to the superconductive gap and persists even when screening effects are considered. We test the model against recent experimental observations in which a strong electric field has been observed to control the supercurrent in superconducting thin films. We find excellent agreement with the experimental data and are able to explain several observed features. We additionally suggest a way to test our theoretical proposal via superconductor-superconductor electron tunneling.},

    title = "{Hydrodynamic magneto-transport in holographic charge density wave states}",
    abstract = {We employ hydrodynamics and gauge/gravity to study magneto-transport in phases of matter where translations are broken (pseudo-)spontaneously. First we provide a hydrodynamic description of systems where translations are broken homogeneously at nonzero lattice pressure and magnetic field. This allows us to determine analytic expressions for all the relevant transport coefficients. Next we construct holographic models of those phases and determine all the DC conductivities in terms of the dual black hole geometry. Combining the hydrodynamic and holographic descriptions we obtain analytic expression for the AC thermo-electric correlators. These are fixed in terms of the black hole geometry and a pinning frequency we determine numerically. We find an excellent agreement between our hydrodynamic and holographic descriptions and show that the holographic models are good avatars for the study of magneto-phonons.},

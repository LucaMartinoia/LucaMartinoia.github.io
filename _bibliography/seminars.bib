    abstract = {Hydrodynamics is a many body effective field theory which describes the dynamics of (almost)-⁠conserved charges in the long wavelength regime. It is the ideal effective field theory to describe systems in which the microscopic degrees of freedom are strongly interacting and in the last years it has been widely used to study strongly coupled condensed matter systems, like high-\(T_c\)~superconductors. In this poster we will study hydrodynamics in presence of (pseudo)-⁠spontaneous symmetry breaking of translations and a constant background magnetic field. This is the hydrodynamic realization of a charge density wave state. We will compute the analytic expressions for the AC thermoelectric conductivities using a recent technique to constraint the value of the transport coefficients in the presence of a magnetic field.},

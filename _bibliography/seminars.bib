    abstract = {Weyl semimetals, a class of topological materials, exhibit a hydrodynamic regime and offer an ideal environment for investigating chiral anomalies through table-top experiments and transport measurements. In this presentation, I will consider a $(3+1)$-dimensional fluid with a $U(1)_V\times U(1)_A$ chiral anomaly as a model of Weyl semimetals. My focus will be on longitudinal thermoelectric magnetotransport, where I will search for relaxation models that meet fundamental and phenomenological constraints, including electric charge conservation, Onsager reciprocity, and finite DC conductivities. I will take into account all possible mixed energy, electric, and axial charge relaxations and show how models which respect these constraints unavoidably render the system open, thus violating the second law of thermodynamics. Furthermore, these relaxations lead to a novel prediction for the DC thermoelectric transport, opening the path to experimental verification. To conclude, I will discuss how mixed relaxations arise naturally from kinetic theory using a modified relaxation time approximation.},

    title = "{Thermoelectric conductivities in Charge Density Waves states from hydrodynamics}",
    abstract = {Hydrodynamics is a many body effective field theory which describes the dynamics of (almost)-⁠conserved charges in the long wavelength regime. It is the ideal effective field theory to describe systems in which the microscopic degrees of freedom are strongly interacting and in the last years it has been widely used to study strongly coupled condensed matter systems, like high-\(T_c\)~superconductors. In this poster we will study hydrodynamics in presence of (pseudo)-⁠spontaneous symmetry breaking of translations and a constant background magnetic field. This is the hydrodynamic realization of a charge density wave state. We will compute the analytic expressions for the AC thermoelectric conductivities using a recent technique to constraint the value of the transport coefficients in the presence of a magnetic field.},

    abstract = {We use advances in the formalism of boost agnostic passive fluids to constrain transport in polar active fluids, which are subsequently described by the Toner-Tu equations. Acknowledging that the system fundamentally breaks boost symmetry we compel what were previously entirely phenomenological parameters in the Toner-Tu model to satisfy precise relationships among themselves. Consequently, we propose a thermodynamic argument to determine the exact scalings of the transport coefficients under dynamical renormalisation group flow. These scalings perfectly agree with the results of recent state-of-the-art numerical simulation and experiments},

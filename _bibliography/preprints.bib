    abstract = {We use advances in the formalism of boost agnostic passive fluids to constrain transport in polar active fluids, which are subsequently described by the Toner-Tu equations. Acknowledging that the system fundamentally breaks boost symmetry we compel what were previously entirely phenomenological parameters in the Toner-Tu model to satisfy precise relationships among themselves. Consequently, we propose a thermodynamic argument to determine the exact scalings of the transport coefficients under dynamical renormalisation group flow. These scalings perfectly agree with the results of recent state-of-the-art numerical simulation and experiments},

    title = "{Dissipative electrically driven fluids}",
    abstract = {We consider entropy generating flows for fluids that achieve a steady state in the presence of a driving electric field. Having chosen one among the space of stationarity constraints that define such flows we show how energy and momentum relaxation are related in the presence of dissipation. Furthermore, we find that if such a fluid obeys Onsager reciprocity then the incoherent conductivity must be
identically zero and consequently makes no contribution to the observable AC or DC charge conductivities.},

    title = "{A note on the canonical approach to hydrodynamics and linear response theory}",
    abstract ={This note provides a comprehensive examination of the various approaches to formulating relativistic hydrodynamics, with a particular emphasis on the canonical approach. Relativistic hydrodynamics plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of fluids in high-energy astrophysical phenomena and heavy-ion collisions. The canonical approach is explored in detail, highlighting its foundational principles, mathematical formulations, and practical implications in modeling relativistic fluid dynamics. Following this, we delve into the linear response theory, elucidating its relevance in the context of hydrodynamics. We analyze the response of relativistic fluids to external perturbations, discussing the theoretical framework and key results. This dual focus aims to bridge the gap between theoretical foundations and practical applications, offering a robust perspective on the dynamic interplay between relativistic hydrodynamics and linear response theory.},

    title = "{Dissipative electrically driven fluids}",
    abstract = {We consider entropy generating flows for fluids that achieve a steady state in the presence of a driving electric field. Having chosen one among the space of stationarity constraints that define such flows we show how energy and momentum relaxation are related in the presence of dissipation. Furthermore, we find that if such a fluid obeys Onsager reciprocity then the incoherent conductivity must be
identically zero and consequently makes no contribution to the observable AC or DC charge conductivities.},
